                Summer time is ‘show time’ for gardening. If we have a dry
                spell, learn what you need to do. You may want to conserve water
                and try out a rain barrel. Also, when gardening take proper
                precautions and learn about those insects, plants and wildlife
                that can pose a risk.

              <h2 class="title">Winter <span>Season</span></h2>
              <p>
                winter, coldest season of the year, between autumn and spring;
                the name comes from an old Germanic word that means “time of
                water” and refers to the rain and snow of winter in middle and
                high latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere it is commonly
                regarded as extending from the winter solstice (year’s shortest
                day), December 21 or 22, to the vernal equinox (day and night
                equal in length), March 20 or 21, and in the Southern Hemisphere
                from June 21 or 22 to September 22 or 23. The low temperatures
                associated with winter occur only in middle and high latitudes;
                in equatorial regions, temperatures are almost uniformly high
                throughout the year. For physical causes of the seasons, see
                season.

              <h2 class="title">Autumn <span>Season</span></h2>
              <p>
                autumn, season of the year between summer and winter during
                which temperatures gradually decrease. It is often called fall
                in the United States because leaves fall from the trees at that
                time. Autumn is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere as
                the period between the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in
                length), September 22 or 23, and the winter solstice (year’s
                shortest day), December 21 or 22; and in the Southern Hemisphere
                as the period between March 20 or 21 and June 21 or 22. The
                autumn temperature transition between summer heat and winter
                cold occurs only in middle and high latitudes; in equatorial
                regions, temperatures generally vary little during the year. In
                the polar regions autumn is very short. For physical causes of
                the seasons, see season.

              <h2 class="title">Spring <span>Season</span></h2>
              <p>
                spring, in climatology, season of the year between winter and
                summer during which temperatures gradually rise. It is generally
                defined in the Northern Hemisphere as extending from the vernal
                equinox (day and night equal in length), March 20 or 21, to the
                summer solstice (year’s longest day), June 21 or 22, and in the
                Southern Hemisphere from September 22 or 23 to December 22 or
                23. The spring temperature transition from winter cold to summer
                heat occurs only in middle and high latitudes; near the Equator,
                temperatures vary little during the year. Spring is very short
                in the polar regions. For physical causes of the seasons, see
                season.

      <h2>Season of the year</h2>
      <p>
        The four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—follow one another
        regularly. Each has its own light, temperature, and weather patterns
        that repeat yearly. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter generally begins
        on December 21 or 22.Learn with us RESOURCE LIBRARY ENCYCLOPEDIC ENTRY
